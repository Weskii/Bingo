# Bingo
Bingo is a comprehensive dog health application that features health and activity tracking as well as a gallery and camera integration to record your pet's growth over the years. Bingo was developed over the course of a semester by a team of like-minded dog lovers who were looking to fill a gap in the relatively-unexlpored "apps for pets" market. 

## Features
Bingo's primary feature is a sort of "Fitbit™️ for your dog." Using Android's integrated GPS package, Bingo can tack walks with your pet and record their distance and time. An activity log records and displays your pet's exercise over the last seven days, helping you keep your peth active and healthy. Bingo also features a health tracking section to record your pets weight, current vaccinations, and veterinarian visits. Finally, each dog has their own gallery space for the owner to take and store pictures.

## Development
Bingo was developed over the course of a Software Design class by four students at Louisiana State University. Each student oversaw development of a single feature, though pair programming was heavily employed throughout implementation.
